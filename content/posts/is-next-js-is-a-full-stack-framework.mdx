# Is Next.js is a full stack frameworkÂ 



Next.js is a popular JavaScript framework for building server-rendered, statically generated, and hybrid web applications. It is built on top of Node.js, and it uses React as its view layer. But is Next.js a full stack framework?

In short, Next.js is not a full stack framework. It is primarily a frontend framework, and it focuses on providing a simple and flexible way to build server-rendered and statically generated React applications. While it does have some built-in support for things like server-side rendering and API routes, it does not provide a complete backend solution.

This does not mean that Next.js cannot be used in a full stack application. In fact, many developers use Next.js as the frontend for their full stack applications, and pair it with a separate backend technology, such as Node.js, Express, Django, or Rails, to handle the server-side logic and data persistence.

One of the advantages of using Next.js as the frontend for a full stack application is that it provides a smooth developer experience and a powerful set of features for building server-rendered and statically generated React applications. It also has a large and active community, with many plugins and tools available to extend its capabilities.

In conclusion, Next.js is not a full stack framework, but it can be used as the frontend for a full stack application. Its focus on server-rendered and statically generated React applications makes it a powerful choice for building modern web applications, and it can be easily paired with a separate backend technology to provide a complete solution
